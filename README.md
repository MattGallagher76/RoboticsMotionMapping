## Project Overview

I would like to develop a simple, articulate robotic arm using 42-40 stepper motors in order to develop different kinematic systems in order to use a variety of inputs such as live motion mapping from external sensor data. 

## Educational Value Added

The work required for this project would help me gain a better understandining of the fundamental of robotics as well as help me understand the seemingly complex math behind inverse kinematics. This aligns with my eventual goal to purpuse the CPE focus area of Controls, Robotics, and Atonomy.
